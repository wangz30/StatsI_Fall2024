	\section*{Question 1: Political Science}
		\vspace{.25cm}
	The following table was created using the data from a study run in a major Latin American city.\footnote{Fried, Lagunes, and Venkataramani (2010). ``Corruption and Inequality at the Crossroad: A Multimethod Study of Bribery and Discrimination in Latin America. \textit{Latin American Research Review}. 45 (1): 76-97.} As part of the experimental treatment in the study, one employee of the research team was chosen to make illegal left turns across traffic to draw the attention of the police officers on shift. Two employee drivers were upper class, two were lower class drivers, and the identity of the driver was randomly assigned per encounter. The researchers were interested in whether officers were more or less likely to solicit a bribe from drivers depending on their class (officers use phrases like, ``We can solve this the easy way'' to draw a bribe). The table below shows the resulting data.


\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{l | c c c }
		& Not Stopped & Bribe requested & Stopped/given warning \\
		\\[-1.8ex] 
		\hline \\[-1.8ex]
		Upper class & 14 & 6 & 7 \\
		Lower class & 7 & 7 & 1 \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\newpage
\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item [(a)]
	Calculate the $\chi^2$ test statistic by hand/manually (even better if you can do "by hand" in \texttt{R}).\
\begin{verbatim}
Answer: The chi-squared test statistic is 3.791168, df = 2
\end{verbatim}
    \lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=38, lastline=66]{PS02_ZexiWang.R} 
\begin{verbatim}
> print(chi_statistic)
[1] 3.791168
> print(df)
[1] 2
\end{verbatim}   
\newpage
	\item [(b)]
	Now calculate the p-value from the test statistic you just created (in \texttt{R}).\footnote{Remember frequency should be $>$ 5 for all cells, but let's calculate the p-value here anyway.}  What do you conclude if $\alpha = 0.1$?\
\begin{verbatim}
Answer: Since the p-value (0.15) > 0.10, we don't have sufficient evidence 
to reject the null hypothesis at the alpha = 0.1 significance level. 
This suggests that there is no significant difference in the likelihood 
of police officers soliciting a bribe from drivers based on their class.
\end{verbatim} 
	\noindent 
	\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=68, lastline=71]{PS02_ZexiWang.R} 
\begin{verbatim}
> print(pvalue)
[1] 0.1502306
\end{verbatim}

	\item [(c)] Calculate the standardized residuals for each cell and put them in the table below.

	\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=73, lastline=88]{PS02_ZexiWang.R}
\begin{verbatim}
> print(standard_residuals_values)
Not Stopped Bribe requested  Stopped/given warning
Upper class   0.3220306       -1.641957               1.523026
Lower class  -0.3220306        1.641957              -1.523026
\end{verbatim} 
		\begin{table}[h]
		\centering
		\begin{tabular}{l | c c c }
			& Not Stopped & Bribe requested & Stopped/given warning \\
			\\[-1.8ex] 
			\hline \\[-1.8ex]
			Upper class   & 0.322 & -1.642 & 1.523  \\
			\\
			Lower class & -0.322 & 1.642  & -1.523   \\
		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
	\vspace{7cm}
	\item [(d)] How might the standardized residuals help you interpret the results?  
\begin{verbatim}
Answer:

1.Standardized residuals with absolute values greater than 2 or less than -2 
are typically considered outliers. According to the table, no observations 
show significant deviations from the model predictions.

2.The standardized residual is very small, which to some extent suggests that 
there is no dependency relationship present.

3.To draw conclusions, it is also necessary to consider the resualt of chi-squared 
test and the p-value.

\section*{Question 2: Economics}
Chattopadhyay and Duflo were interested in whether women promote different policies than men.\footnote{Chattopadhyay and Duflo. (2004). ``Women as Policy Makers: Evidence from a Randomized Policy Experiment in India. \textit{Econometrica}. 72 (5), 1409-1443.} Answering this question with observational data is pretty difficult due to potential confounding problems (e.g. the districts that choose female politicians are likely to systematically differ in other aspects too). Hence, they exploit a randomized policy experiment in India, where since the mid-1990s, $\frac{1}{3}$ of village council heads have been randomly reserved for women. A subset of the data from West Bengal can be found at the following link: \url{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kosukeimai/qss/master/PREDICTION/women.csv}\\

\noindent Each observation in the data set represents a village and there are two villages associated with one GP (i.e. a level of government is called "GP"). Figure~\ref{fig:women_desc} below shows the names and descriptions of the variables in the dataset. The authors hypothesize that female politicians are more likely to support policies female voters want. Researchers found that more women complain about the quality of drinking water than men. You need to estimate the effect of the reservation policy on the number of new or repaired drinking water facilities in the villages.

\newpage
\begin{enumerate}
	\item [(a)] State a null and alternative (two-tailed) hypothesis. 
\begin{verbatim}
Answer:

Ho = Having reserved village council heads for female does not affect the number 
drinking water facilities in the villages.

Ha = Having reserved village council heads for female affects the number drinking 
water facilities in the villages.
\end{verbatim} 

	\item [(b)] Run a bivariate regression to test this hypothesis in \texttt{R} (include your code!).

\end{verbatim} 

	\item [(c)] Interpret the coefficient estimate for reservation policy. 
\begin{verbatim}
Answer:

Since the p-value (approximately 0.02) < 0.05, we have sufficient evidence to 
reject the null hypothesis at the alpha = 0.05 significance level. This suggests 
that Having reserved seats for female politicians increase the number drinking 
water facilities in the villages.
